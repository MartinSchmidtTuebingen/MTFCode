Code for the Multi-Template-Fit Projekt in ALICE.

Usage:
- Run "./runAnalysis.sh init" to initialise the MTF project
- Run "./runAnalysis.sh create <PROJECT_NAME> to create a project folder (name should start with LHC to be hidden by gitignore)
- Adjust config.json in analysis folder to your parameters (explanation further down) (ATTENTION: Many parameters are still hard-coded in macros!)
- Run "./runAnalysis.sh <PROJECT_NAME>" to run a specific analysis
- Run "./runAnalysis.sh <PROJECT_NAME> -h" to get possible parameters

Fast simulation:
- Download MC data (inclusive and jet) in mcPath set in json (not yet automatic)
- Run "./runAnalysis <PROJECT_NAME> -t fitsim" to fit the fast simulation parameters. Check if the outcome (fastSimulationParameters* in "mcData" looks good. If not, you might have to change the base fast simulation parameters in config.json (TODO: Automatize this checking checking procedure)
- Run the train with the correct fast simulation parameters (Explanation needed!!)
- Download data in the appropriate folders (automatize procedure!)
- Run "./runAnalysis <PROJECT_NAME> -t mcjetsys" to create the systematic files for the (jet) MCCorrection. They are loaded automatically in the efficiency calculation later
